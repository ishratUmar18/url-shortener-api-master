# URL Shortener API Master
This is a solution for the **Links Shortener Challenge** by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/). The challenge is to create a landing page that integrates with the shrtcode API to shorten URLs and display the shortened links to the user.

This solution uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as a build tool. [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is used for styling. The shortened URLs are generated using the [shrtcode API](https://shrtco.de/).
